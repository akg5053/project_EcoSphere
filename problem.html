        <h2>How Pollution is Degrading the Environment</h2>
        <p>
          Pollution is a pervasive and destructive force that threatens the
          survival of ecosystems and human health. It affects all aspects of
          life, from air and water to soil and living organisms. Here are some
          major environmental issues caused by pollution:
        </p>
        <ul class="degradation-points">
          <li>
            <strong >Air Pollution:</strong> The rapid industrialization,
            urbanization, and reliance on fossil fuels have led to severe air
            pollution. Industrial emissions and vehicle exhaust release harmful
            gases like carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and
            particulate matter. These pollutants contribute to:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Global Warming:</strong> Greenhouse gases trap heat in
                the atmosphere, leading to a rise in global temperatures and
                exacerbating climate change.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Smog:</strong> In urban areas, smog created by air
                pollution reduces visibility, increases respiratory illnesses,
                and causes premature deaths.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Acid Rain:</strong> The release of sulfur dioxide and
                nitrogen oxides from factories and vehicles results in acid
                rain, which damages crops, forests, and buildings.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ozone Layer Depletion:</strong> The thinning of the
                ozone layer due to pollutants like CFCs allows harmful UV rays
                to reach Earth's surface, causing skin cancer and eye cataracts.
              </li>
            </ul>

              />
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Water Pollution:</strong> Water bodies around the world are
            increasingly polluted by agricultural runoff, industrial discharge,
            and untreated sewage. Pollutants such as chemicals, plastics, and
            heavy metals seep into oceans, rivers, and lakes, leading to severe
            consequences:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Oil Spills:</strong> Spills from ships and drilling rigs
                harm aquatic life, damage ecosystems, and disrupt marine food
                chains.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Nutrient Pollution:</strong> Excessive use of
                fertilizers in agriculture results in nutrient pollution, which
                causes algal blooms. These blooms reduce oxygen levels in the
                water, killing fish and other aquatic organisms.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Waterborne Diseases:</strong> Contaminated water from
                industrial or agricultural waste leads to diseases such as
                cholera, typhoid, and dysentery, which pose major public health
                risks.
              </li>
            </ul>

            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Soil Degradation:</strong> Soil is a vital resource for
            growing crops, but excessive use of chemical fertilizers,
            pesticides, and industrial waste disposal has resulted in soil
            contamination and degradation. This includes:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Soil Erosion:</strong> Overgrazing, deforestation, and
                poor land management lead to the removal of topsoil, making it
                difficult for plants to grow and reducing agricultural
                productivity.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Salinization:</strong> Over-irrigation, especially in
                arid regions, leads to the accumulation of salts in the soil,
                making it unsuitable for farming and reducing crop yields.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Heavy Metal Contamination:</strong> Industrial
                activities introduce heavy metals like lead, mercury, and
                arsenic into the soil, which contaminate food supplies and harm
                human health.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="image-container">

            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Deforestation:</strong> The destruction of forests for
            urbanization, agriculture, and logging is one of the leading causes
            of biodiversity loss. Forests are essential for regulating the
            climate, providing oxygen, and supporting a wide variety of species.
            The effects of deforestation include:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Loss of Biodiversity:</strong> The clearing of forests
                destroys habitats for countless plant and animal species,
                driving them to extinction.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Disruption of Water Cycles:</strong> Deforestation can
                lead to the drying of local water sources and desertification,
                especially in regions that depend on forests for rainfall.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Increased Carbon Emissions:</strong> Trees absorb carbon
                dioxide, a major greenhouse gas. Deforestation not only releases
                carbon into the atmosphere but also reduces the Earthâ€™s ability
                to absorb CO2, thus accelerating climate change.
              </li>
            </ul>

            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Plastic Pollution:</strong> Plastic waste, which is
            non-biodegradable, accumulates in landfills and oceans, causing
            severe harm to ecosystems and wildlife. Its effects include:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Threat to Marine Life:</strong> Marine animals ingest
                plastic, mistaking it for food, which can lead to their deaths
                through starvation, suffocation, or internal injuries.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Microplastic Contamination:</strong> Small plastic
                particles known as microplastics have entered the food chain,
                affecting not only marine life but also terrestrial animals and
                humans who consume seafood.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Flooding:</strong> Plastic waste clogs waterways,
                drains, and sewage systems, leading to blocked water flow and
                increased risk of urban flooding.
              </li>
